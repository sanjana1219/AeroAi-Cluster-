A Deep Dive into Airline Delays

Project Overview


Air transport plays a critical role in connecting people, businesses, and economies across the world. However, flight delays significantly impact airline operations, passenger satisfaction, and overall transportation efficiency.
This project analyzes real-world airline delay data using data mining techniques to identify delay patterns, major contributing factors, and performance differences among airlines. The study applies clustering methods to group airlines based on their delay characteristics and generate meaningful insights for improving operational efficiency.


Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

 •	To analyze airline flight delay data using real-world aviation datasets

 •	To identify the key factors that contribute to flight delays

 •	To apply data mining techniques, particularly K-Means clustering, to group airlines based on delay patterns

 •	To explore relationships between different types of delay causes such as weather, carrier issues, and air traffic congestion

 •	To visualize delay trends and patterns for better understanding

 •	To provide data-driven insights that can support airlines, airports, and policymakers in reducing delays and improving efficiency


Research Question

What were the principal factors that contributed to airline delays during December 2019 and 2020?

Key Findings


Cluster Results

The analysis identified three major airline groups:

Cluster 1 – High Delay Airlines

 •	Frequent and severe delays

 •	Major causes: late aircraft and carrier issues

Cluster 2 – Best On-Time Performance Airlines

 •	Minimal delays

 •	Efficient scheduling and operations

Cluster 3 – Moderate Delay Airlines

 •	Average delay levels

 •	Influenced mainly by weather and air traffic congestion
 

Major Causes of Flight Delays


The most significant delay factors identified were:

 •	Late aircraft arrivals

 •	Carrier operational issues

 •	National Aviation System congestion

Weather delays had a moderate impact compared to operational and traffic-related factors.
